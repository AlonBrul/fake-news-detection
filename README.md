# fake-news-detection
This is my college studies final project. The code is in two google colab notebooks, the dataset is in a different repository.<br>
* In 'Fake_news_encoding.ipynb' notebook we prepare and transform our dataset.<br>
* In 'Fake_news_learning.ipynb' notebook we build ML models on which we train and test our transformed datasets.<br>
* 'Fake news detection.docx' is the project final report where you will find extended description of the project (the file is written in Hebrew).
